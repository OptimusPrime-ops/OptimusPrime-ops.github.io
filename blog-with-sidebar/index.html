                    <p>
                        At the heart of this narrative lies Messmer the Impaler,
                        a demigod and possibly the first child of Marika, who is
                        tasked by his mother with a cleansing crusade in the 
                        Land of Shadow. Messmer’s story from the outside looks 
                        to be classic evil villain stuff, but if you look 
                        closely, there are layers to his motivations that can 
                        completely change your perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Messmer the Impaler is a demigod and the supposed 
                        firstborn son of Marika, who resides in the Shadow Keep.
                        He was tasked with using his potent fire magic to purge 
                        the Hornsent of the land and to burn anything deemed 
                        impure to the Golden Order.
                    </p>

                    <h3>"Those stripped of the Grace of Gold shall all meet 
                        death, in the embrace of Messmer's flame."</h3>
                        <img 
                        src="images/Messmer.jpg" 
                        alt="Messmer"
                        width="200px">
                    <p>
                    All across the Land of Shadow, you can see Messmer’s 
                    influence and how he has become a symbol of fear, with a 
                    lot of characters wanting revenge against the demigod for 
                    their people’s genocide.
                    Messmer committed these massacres from his throne in the 
                    Shadow Keep, though after the Land of Shadow is veiled and 
                    Messmer is abandoned by his mother, he loses faith in the 
                    crusade.
                    All that resentment he had for being a Lord of nothing 
                    because of Marika’s task reaches its peak when you walk 
                    into his throne room for the first time. He’s surprised at 
                    a tarnished entering the Land of Shadow and knows now that 
                    his mother has truly abandoned him.
