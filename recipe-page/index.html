            <h1>Preparing the Croissants</h1>

            <p>First, let’s get our croissants ready. Preheat your oven to 350°F
                (175°C). Slice the top off each croissant and gently carve out 
                the center, creating a boat-like shape. Be careful not to cut 
                through the bottom or sides—you want to create a perfect little 
                vessel for our delicious fillings. Once you’ve carved out the 
                center, press down to make a well, ensuring there’s enough space
                 for the eggs and other ingredients. This step is crucial as it 
                 creates a sturdy base to hold all the tasty ingredients without
                  spilling over. You can buy croissants from anywhere but my 
                  favorites are from Costco or Sam’s Club.
