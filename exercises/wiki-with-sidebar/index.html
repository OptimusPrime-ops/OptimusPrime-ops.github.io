                <p>
                    Transformers: Fall of Cybertron is a third-person shooter 
                    video game based on the Transformers franchise, developed 
                    by High Moon Studios and published by Activision. It is the 
                    sequel to the 2010 video game 
                    Transformers: War for Cybertron, and directly follows the 
                    events of that game, as the Autobots struggle to defeat 
                    their Decepticon foes in a civil war for their home planet 
                    of Cybertron. The game was released on August 21, 2012, in 
                    North America and on August 24, 2012, in Europe for 
                    Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. In 2016, 
                    it was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on August 8, 
                    in Australia and on August 9, in North America. Mercenary 
                    Technology developed the game's Windows version, while Fun 
                    Labs developed the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Set as the prequel to Transformers: Prime, the game tells 
                    the story of the Transformers, fictional robotic life forms,
                     and the final days of conflict on their home planet of 
                     Cybertron. An origins subplot for the Dinobots is also 
                     told, reimagined from the Transformers: Generation 1 
                     continuity. Other subplots also tell an adapted story for 
                     several characters. Some of the voice cast from the 1984 
                     series The Transformers return to reprise their roles, 
                     including Peter Cullen as Autobot leader Optimus Prime and 
                     Gregg Berger as Grimlock. Other actors return to reprise 
                     their roles from Transformers: War for Cybertron.

                    Fall of Cybertron received generally favorable reviews from 
                    critics. Critics generally felt that the game was true to 
                    the Transformers franchise and provided good fan service, 
                    but some thought that the story pace slowed at times. 
                    Gameplay was mostly praised, but some reviewers cited the 
                    removal of War for Cybertron's cooperative campaign as a 
                    low point. Graphics and audio also received broadly positive
                     comments. A spin-off, Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,
                      which is partially set between War for Cybertron and Fall 
                      of Cybertron, was released in June 2014. Later, following 
                      the expiration of the licensing deal between Activision 
                      and Hasbro, the game title was delisted from digital 
                      storefronts.

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, like its predecessor 
                    Transformers: War for Cybertron, is a third-person shooter. 
                    Players can control each transformer in both its robot and 
                    vehicle forms. Instead of a traditional health system, 
                    the game features a system similar to the Halo series of 
                    video games. The player character has both a regenerating 
                    shield and health, the latter of which can be replenished 
                    by a health pack.[1] The weapon selection in Fall of 
                    Cybertron is expanded, with new weapons that can take on 
                    very significant upgrades, including one that allows a 
                    weapon to fire up to 75% faster. These are purchased through
                    Teletran 1 kiosks found throughout the game.[2]
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every character has been given their own unique ability. 
                    For example, Jazz can fire a grappling hook to reach high 
                    or distant places,[3] Optimus Prime can command the massive 
                    Metroplex, and the Combaticons have the ability to combine 
                    into the Decepticon Bruticus. Segments in which players 
                    control Bruticus are designed to accommodate its larger 
                    size. Scale is maintained so the character towers over 
                    enemies.[4] The Autobot Grimlock, who transforms into a 
                    robotic Tyrannosaurus, is controlled differently than other 
                    characters. Carrying only a sword and shield, Grimlock 
                    cannot transform at will, instead accumulating rage as he 
                    battles opponents. When he gains enough rage, Grimlock is 
                    able to transform and inflict massive damage.[4] The online 
                    cooperative campaign play featured in the first game has 
                    been removed in favor of levels that utilize each 
                    character's specific abilities.[5]

                    The survival mode Escalation from War for Cybertron returns.
                     In this mode players must defend against increasingly 
                     difficult waves of enemies. As gameplay progresses, new 
                     sections of the level open, which give players access to 
                     upgraded weapons and abilities. Franchise characters are 
                     used in Escalation, while players can customize one of four
                      character classes (Scientist, Infiltrator, Destroyer, and 
                      Titan) on 9 different maps (Sewers, Spire, Abandoned, 
                      Bowels, Array, Corrosion, Tempest, Convoy, Desolation) in 
                      competitive multiplayer.[6] Autobot and Decepticon 
                      Transformers can be customized with parts earned through a
                       ranking system or purchased through the game's 
                       marketplace. Several parts from famous Transformers can 
                       be used, such as heads, torsos, legs, and arms. Hundreds 
                       of pieces and color options are available.[6] Players can
                        also buy and upgrade their gear.[5]
